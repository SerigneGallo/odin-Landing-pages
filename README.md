# Landing Page Project

## Introduction

This project is part of the Foundations Course at The Odin Project. It's designed to practice HTML and CSS skills by creating a webpage from a provided design. This exercise focuses on implementing a given design with attention to detail, without the need to match it pixel-perfectly.

## Project Overview

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a landing page based on a provided design. The design was given in the form of two images: one showcasing the full website and another detailing the fonts and colors used.

### Goals:

- Implement a webpage from a static design.
- Use HTML and CSS to structure and style the page.
- Focus on layout and positioning with CSS Flexbox.

## Technologies Used
